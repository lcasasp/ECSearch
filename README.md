# Flare
Flare is an interactive search engine tailored to find and rank current events and news media related to the global climate and energy use crisis. 

Flare will have the search bar users can query to find all current events about climate change and Energy from hundreds if not thousands of news sources and research papers. This would allow the user to perform a search for all news companies, solving the issue of bias previously existing if users searched for topics on a singular news company website. Additionally, this content will be tailored for the climate and energy dual challenge as the data is indexed with Lucene multiple times to best refine the result.
